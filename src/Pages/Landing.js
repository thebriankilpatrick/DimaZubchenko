// My idea is the landing page will display a full page image of his work
// In the state, I'll have a timer, and at the end of the timer, 
// a new image will display at random from his portfolio.
// The user can also click an arrow at either side of the screen, which will reset the timer
// and display a new image.
// There will be a button... in the middle?  Or perhaps just the navbar.
// There, the user will be able to navigate to the full portfolio, and access contact info
